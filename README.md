Description
How do we conciliate bio-hazard and on-field re-usability whilst minimizing both risks to the crew and building materials waste?

A blend of earth-made, high-durability components (e.g. syringe needle, cleaning/heating vessel), and meltable ones (thermometer tips), along with attention to the safety of various processes (be it during the assembly, cleaning, or mere use of the tools), could be neat.

This is going to be a systemic exploration of the matters at hand.
