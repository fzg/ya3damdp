After a bit of openscad modeling, realize two missing features:
mechanics (spring-lever) and material (to specify that the needle needs have a magnetized end)
There, a quest begins. Quest for an usable, simulation package that's easy to tweak (materials, forces).
-> Lack of all-in one OSS cam/cad with mechanics, EM, simulation / material property
Looked at opencascade, broken deb. Python rants...
Looked at trying brl-cad, saw cheat-sheet, nope.

Looking up Product Lifecycle Management suites, as a side dish
Trying to get access to Solidworks, hopefuly.

In the meantime, drawing sketches.
