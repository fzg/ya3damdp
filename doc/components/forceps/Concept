Five part design: (plus nuts and bolts)


Let's take a conventional forceps pair

If we want to sterilize only the needles: Remove the end of the handle, cast the tip of the needles to allow for lock-in by turning into the handle

How do we sense the forces applied and counter it ?


CHALLENGE: fine control in low-gravity
	Computerized handles ? Use resistivity deltas?

TODO See how tools are made
