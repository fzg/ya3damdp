We got 4 parts:

1/ needles
	Made on earth, the end of the shaft is ferromagnetic, to allow for machne-assisted unfitting and fitting
2/ cylinders
	Possibly pre-filled,
	Hypothesis A. refillable after decontamination. Glass-like material?
		we could envision re-melting as well, the TOTRANSLATE rondelle being outset
	Hypothesis B. 3D printed:
		after the first layers set, the machine projects a magnetic TOTRANSLATE rondelle to hold the needle
		(it's inset)
		this part is saved at the end of the melting process
3/ air-tight piston/plunger
	TBD
4/ actuation mechanism
	Easily fitted, reusable, idiot-proof trigger. Look up what armies use for inspiration
	(spring-loaded?)
