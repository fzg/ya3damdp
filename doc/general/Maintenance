We need:

	a/ a manageable cleansing fluid, easily separatable from organic waste
	b/ a way to filter that fluid, store waste efficiently
	c/ that fluid must not contaminate what is melt


Let's assume one vessel. It's metal or ceramics.
It's surrounded by a magnetic coil, which can be fed in different ways:
	a. to generate a magnetic field to push in / out magnetised content
	b. to heat by induction to different levels: for decontamination / plastics melting / [glass melting?]
It possesses an ultrasound transciever device, to agitate cleansing fluid inside

It's cylindric, has multiple ports:
A big one allowing bulk loading of matter and unloading of sterilized objects
A very small one, fitted with an extruding aparatus, possibly
Alternatively, we could cast some pieces, using a neutral gas to push molten matter into profiles cut onto cylinders fitted to
that opening



Use cases:
		Sterilization


		Plastics melting


		Glass melting



Separation of waste from liquid: find a thermoplastic such as to obtain multiple phases?


Feeder : can feed cleansing chemical and/or gas. with valve.

Pressure monitoring: !?
UI:	microcontroller, multi position switch for mode, push buttons, lcd?
Interlocks: by using the pressure monitoring?
